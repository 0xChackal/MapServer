# MapServer Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability in MapServer

Security/vulnerability reports should not be submitted through GitHub tickets or the public mailing lists, but instead please send your report 
to the email address: **mapserver-security nospam @ osgeo.org** (remove the blanks and ‘nospam’).  

Please follow the general guidelines for bug 
submissions, when describing the vulnerability (see https://mapserver.org/development/bugs.html).

## Supported Versions

The MapServer PSC (Project Steering Committee) will release patches for security vulnerabilities 
for the last release branch of the two most recent release series (such as 8.x, 7.x. 6.x, etc...). 
Patches will only be provided for a period of three years from the release date of the current series.
For example, once 8.0 is released, then only 8.0.x and 7.6.x will be supported/patched and 7.6.x will
only be supported for three years from the date of the 8.0 series release.

Currently, the following versions are supported:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 7.6.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 7.4.x   | :x:                |
