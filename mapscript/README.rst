MapServer MapScript Modules
===========================

Much of MapServer's functionality is accessible from Java, Perl, PHP, Python,
Ruby, C#, and Tcl.  MapScript is not a language like JavaScript or Python. It
is a loadable module that brings MapServer capabilities to your favorite high
level programming language.

PHP and SWIG Branches of MapScript
----------------------------------

The MapScript family tree looks like this:

::

               MapServer
                  /\ 
                 /  \    
                /    \ 
     PHPMapScript     \  SWIGMapScript
         PHP5/7    +----+-----+----+----+--+----+------------+
                   |    |     |    |    |  |    |            |
                 Perl Python Ruby Java C# Tcl  PHP7 (PHPNG) ...
                 


The SWIGMapScript modules are generated by `SWIG <http://www.swig.org>`_. 
The PHPMapScript module is developed using the PHP C API without using SWIG. 
PHP users therefore have a choice of using the SWIG generated module or the 
custom written PHP module. 

PHPMapScript
------------

Source code, detailed installation instructions, and module API are located
under mapscript/php.

SWIG MapScript
--------------

Installation instructions are located in the individual languages
directories such as mapscript/perl, mapscript/python.  

The main MapScript SWIG interface file is mapscript/mapscript.i.  This
file includes specific class interface files from mapscript/swiginc and
language specific code from the language directories.
